            <p>
                Since I was young, I have always been interested 
                in websites and how they were developed; being entranced 
                in trying to figure out what the weird symbols and words 
                mean whenever I pressed F12 on the keyboard. Thankfully,
                I was able to get my first steps into the right direction
                into web development with online tutorials and Google.

                Throughout college, I have been working on improving
                my skills related to Front-end development, but also
                started to include work on Backend development; I felt
                as if I needed to prepare myself for the real world
                once I graduate from college.

                Fast forward to today, I have gathered many years of 
                experience, refining my skills and incorporating more
                technologies to my resume. Working throughout numerous
                companies and freelancing my services to clients, I have
                built a strong portfolio; showcasing my skills and
                making others confident in that whenever I am
                employed, I will deliver effecient websites and 
                systems behind.
